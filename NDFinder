# NDFinder (New Domains Finder) is a bash script I wrote for searching recently created domains which may be 
# suspicious of being used for phishing activities.

# This script crawls through domain-status.com looking for recently created domain names with a variable on the name.
# For example, if you'd like to find all new domains created which contains the word "bank", just set the variable and run # the script.
# The script should be run daily as it searches through all the domains created 1 day ago. Run a cron for this.
# 
# Feel free to share or improve 
# Currently TLDs supported: com, org, info, biz, us, name, aero. (This tools crawls through domain-status.com only)

# Search pattern
VARIABLE1="banco"

TLD=(com org info biz us name aero)
# Date is always one day ago (because domain-status.com works on a daily basis)
DATE=$(date -v-1d +%Y-%-m-%d)
